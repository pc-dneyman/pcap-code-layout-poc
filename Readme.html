Enhanced code layout POC:

0.  NO CHANGES to current deployment setup and resulting artifacts'.     
    Pom files of actual projects are unchanged.
    ================================================================

    Some refactoring will be required, but it should definitely benefit overall
    code cleanup initiative.

    This does not solve all problems that we have related to building and 
    dependencies. But brings in new level of flexibility and convinience.


1.  Critique of Profiles:      
    =====================

    In most cases they should be used for other than build ordering reasons
    (like branching Dev vs Prod deployment  differences or turn on/off certain
    settings).

    But what is extremly critical here is that -Pxyz forces Maven to rely on the
    explicit order of compilation specified  in POM file!

    At the same time standard <modules> element in "parent POM" project will
    sort out all dependencies on its own.

    Even if they specified in randon order! When cyclic dependency are
    discovered Maven will simply abort with clear  error message.

    When adding new module, currently we have to place it in many profiles and
    in the right place within the profile.

    With new layout, we need to simply place it inside correct folder and add
    entry in its parent POM.


2.  Code organization:     
    ===================

    We group code in classes, packages and jars to enable code reuse, to ease
    management of the related code and to help  discovery of logic within the
    codebase.

    But many jars on the same level do not reveal anything about their
    interdependence - in a same way that many public  functions in one class
    introduct management and testing challenges. It is getting very hard to
    ensure and preempt appearance  of cyclic dpeendencis and it is hard to
    manage code.

    Proposed solution is to group semantically (logically, horizontally)
    relevant jars under the same "folder" - each with  its own "parent POM".

    Each "folder bound POM" will know how to build set of jars inside its folder
    - they are all listed within "modules" element.

    There are obviousely interdependencies between those jars, but "parent POM"
    by virtue Maven's feature itself resolves  all of them automatically, if not
    - shows the error.

    The topmost "grand-parent POM" knows only about its "child POMs" and nothing
    about individual jars behind them.

    Again it will sort out "child POMs" dependencies on its own, during the
    build. Alghough keeping them in proper order  in POM file iself is a good
    practice.


3.  Design & testability benefits:     
    ==============================

    Such a structure is helpful from the "Design" point of view, as it naturally
    promotes proper placement of new code  wihtin overall code infrastructure.

    It makes Testing (espcially integration or functional testing) very isolated
    and well targeted.

    F.e. we can imagine some common set of tools or some light in-house
    framework that resides inside the "layer folder" and as  such creates common
    ground to test all projects inside this folder.

    For "apps" folder it could be some Spring MVC stuff (just for the sake of
    agruments).

    For "core" folder, exposing functional APIs, it could be set of Python
    utilities that call end-points and parse results.

    For "external integration" folder, it could be common test harnes that
    generates different pre-canned responses  based on the type of service in
    the request (10 flavors of Yodlee respones, 20 flavors of Xignite responses,
    etc.)

    From day-to-day code maintanace we can test category at once before submitting 
    code and not worry about  other "layers".

    Currently to do this we have to manually navigate from module to module.


4.  Jenkins benefits:     
    =====================

    Many useful variations of build scenarios - locally and in Jenkins. Navigate
    into a folder or point to desired pom.xml from  any other location. No need
    to know which profile to use.

    Proposed structure will save a lot of build time locally and in Jenkins. We
    can send only a single changed "layer" to compile  and test in Jenkins.

    Having all others "layers" frozen before release allows very fine grained
    control over what is changed and what could be the implications.

    F.e. if public API within a "layer" did not change, we need to
    clean/build/test in Jenkins only "this" layer. All higher  layers should
    *only* be tested in Jenkins!

    It is no different from what we have right now in essence, but with Profile
    controlled build we can't implement it. If sp-core  changed and it is the
    only change and it is internal to sp-core, we still have to build/test ALL,
    because there is no other way to do it.


5.  Eclipse:     
    =========

    IDE should lighten up because we can quickly load a single "layer" in focus.
    Which does not prevent from loading all,  by importing "grandparent POM". Or
    or loading a "layer" in focus, plus any individual projects from other
    layers.


6.  Versioning of artifacts:     
    ========================

    This structure does not solve directly problem of managing mulit-versioned
    artifacts used by different applicatons, but it can  help it by facilitating
    a versioned bundles of jars.

    Also, we can use "provided" scope for the whole "bundle/layer", so that
    current work within the layer is not affecting released  "apps" until new
    version is certified and published.

    F.e. all jars in "base" layer can be pushed into artifactory and used by
    "apps" without need to compile them - as provided  dependency

7.  Deployment possibilities:     
    =========================

    Proposed structure does not benefit directly to the way we deploy and
    organize web apps currently.

    But it may come useful if we will one day adapt such popular maven-like
    container configurations as found in JBoss7, for example.

    Another aspect of this change, could be in using "provided" scope for our
    own "foundation / low level" layers.

    For example, at certain point in time we publish int artifactory Core-
    Bundle-V1.

    At this point all Apps in production will use this version of core jars.

    At the same time, Admin app, could exclusively start using new bundle Core-
    Bundle-V2, that is not yet certified for all apps.

    Again, this is achievable with with current setup as well - no questions.
    But it is less flexible.
